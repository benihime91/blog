Hi! I am Ayushman, a 3rd Year Undergrad student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) at the Central Institue of Technology , Kokrajhar (CIT Kokrajhar). 

I am originally from the small city of Guwahati, Assam in India which hosts the smallest river island in the world.

I have recently started a new path towards Deep Learning. As of writing, I am officialy 5 months into this journey of learning. Pursuing this goal of Deep Learning has made me realize that learned that I love problem solving. I aspire to be on the forefront developing algorithms in all aspects of Deep Learning. I am interested in research related to deep learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning.

I enjoy coding in Python. Python to me is one of the most wonderful computer languages ever created. Recently I also started learning Julia language. My [github account](https://github.com/benihime91) hosts all of my code and documentation, which includes all the notebooks from the blog posts as well as any projects.

There are quite a few things I am passionate about in life, and Deep Learning is just one facet of my life. I enjoy reading novels in my free-time especially the ones with thriller and mystery elements in it.
